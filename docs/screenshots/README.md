# Screenshot Guide

Use these image file names so `README.md` always shows images correctly:

- `01-home-hero.png`
- `02-filters.png`
- `03-collection.png`

How to replace:

1. Take a screenshot from your live site.
2. Rename it to one of the file names above.
3. Put it in this folder (`docs/screenshots/`).
4. Commit and push.
